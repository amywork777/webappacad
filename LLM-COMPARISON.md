# LLM Provider Comparison for AI-CAD

This document compares OpenAI and Anthropic as LLM providers for the AI-CAD web application, helping you choose the right provider for your needs.

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | OpenAI (o3) | Anthropic (Claude 3 Sonnet) |
|---------|-------------|---------------------------|
| **Code Generation** | Excellent code quality, high accuracy for FreeCAD syntax | Good code quality, occasionally needs more guidance for FreeCAD specifics |
| **3D Understanding** | Strong spatial reasoning and dimensional accuracy | Strong conceptual understanding, occasionally less precise dimensions |
| **Response Time** | Generally faster responses | Slightly longer response times |
| **Cost** | Higher per-token cost | Lower per-token cost |
| **Instruction Following** | Excellent at following specific CAD instructions | Very good, occasionally more verbose |
| **Error Handling** | Robust error handling and recovery | Good error handling, sometimes more creative solutions |

## Strength Areas

### OpenAI (o3)
- Precise dimensional specifications
- Accurate FreeCAD Python syntax
- Faster for simpler shapes
- Better at following exact technical specifications

### Anthropic (Claude 3 Sonnet)
- More creative interpretations of ambiguous designs
- Often better explanations in comments
- More cost-effective for high-volume usage
- Sometimes better at understanding complex shape descriptions

## Example Use Cases

| Use Case | Recommended Provider |
|----------|----------------------|
| **Precise Technical Parts** | OpenAI |
| **Creative Design Interpretation** | Anthropic |
| **High Volume, Cost-Sensitive** | Anthropic |
| **Performance-Critical** | OpenAI |
| **Educational/Explanatory** | Anthropic |

## Switching Strategy

The application supports easy switching between providers via the `LLM_PROVIDER` environment variable. Consider these strategies:

1. **A/B Testing**: Run with OpenAI for a week, then Anthropic, and compare results
2. **Use-Case Based**: Use OpenAI for precision engineering tasks, Anthropic for more creative design tasks
3. **Cost Optimization**: Use Anthropic as default, switch to OpenAI for complex technical designs

## Implementation Notes

The application uses a unified API abstraction (`llm.py`) that standardizes the prompt and response formats across providers:

```python
def ask_llm(prompt: str) -> str:
    if PROVIDER == "anthropic":
        # Anthropic implementation
    else:
        # OpenAI implementation (default)
```

## Prompt Engineering Considerations

For optimal results with both providers, consider:

1. **Be specific**: Include precise dimensions and relations
2. **Use consistent terminology**: Stick to standard CAD terms
3. **For OpenAI**: More concise, technical prompts work well
4. **For Anthropic**: Slightly more descriptive prompts are beneficial

## Future Improvements

As both models evolve, consider:

1. **Provider-specific prompting**: Slightly different prompts optimized for each provider
2. **Prompt templates**: Different templates based on model strengths
3. **Hybrid approach**: Use OpenAI for technical CAD code, Anthropic for design interpretation

## Conclusion

Both OpenAI and Anthropic provide high-quality results for the AI-CAD application. The right choice depends on your specific priorities (precision vs. cost vs. creativity). The application's architecture allows easy switching to accommodate changing needs.
