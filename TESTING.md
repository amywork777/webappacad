# Testing the AI-CAD Web Application

This document provides detailed instructions for testing the application locally and verifying that both text-to-CAD and image-to-CAD conversions work correctly.

## Prerequisites

Before testing, ensure you have:

1. Docker installed and running
2. Python 3.x with pip
3. Node.js and npm
4. Valid API keys for either OpenAI or Anthropic (or both)

## Testing Process

### 1. Configure Environment Variables

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and add your API keys:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file and add your API keys:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
LLM_PROVIDER=openai  # or "anthropic"
```

### 2. Build the Docker Image

The Docker image contains FreeCAD and the Machine learning for CAD Parameters (MCP) tools:

```bash
docker build -t webcad-fc .
```

### 3. Set Up the Backend

Create a Python virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

Start the backend server:

```bash
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
```

### 4. Set Up the Frontend

Install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 5. Testing Features

Visit http://localhost:5173 in your browser to access the application.

#### Text-to-CAD Testing

1. Enter a text description in the text area (e.g., "120 mm bottle")
2. Click the "Text â†’ STEP" button
3. Wait for the model to be generated
4. The STEP file should download automatically

#### Image-to-CAD Testing

1. Upload an image using the file input
2. Optionally add descriptive text in the text area to guide the conversion
3. Wait for the model to be generated
4. The STEP file should download automatically

### 6. Automated Testing Script

For convenience, we've provided a `test_commands.sh` script that automates the setup and launches both servers:

```bash
chmod +x test_commands.sh
./test_commands.sh
```

## Testing Tips

1. **Simple Shapes First**: Start with simple shapes like "cube with 50mm sides" or "cylinder with 30mm diameter and 100mm height"
2. **Verify LLM Provider**: Test with both OpenAI and Anthropic by changing the `LLM_PROVIDER` in your `.env` file
3. **Image Quality**: For image-to-CAD, use clear images with good lighting and minimal background noise
4. **Browser Console**: Keep the browser console open to see any frontend errors
5. **Backend Logs**: Monitor the uvicorn logs for backend errors

## Troubleshooting

### Docker Issues

- Verify Docker is running with `docker ps`
- Check if the image was built correctly with `docker images | grep webcad-fc`
- If Docker commands fail with permission errors, use `sudo` or add your user to the docker group

### API Key Issues

- Ensure your API keys are correctly set in the `.env` file
- Verify the API keys are valid and have the necessary permissions
- Check the backend logs for API authentication errors

### File Permission Issues

- For Docker volume mounts, ensure the directories have appropriate permissions
- If temporary files aren't being created/accessed, check `/tmp` directory permissions

### Network Issues

- Ensure ports 8000 (backend) and 5173 (frontend) are available
- Check that the frontend is correctly proxying API requests to the backend

If you encounter persistent issues, please check the backend logs and browser console for specific error messages.
